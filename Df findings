1. We should in ideal case use client+port as unique combination to account for effects of NAT translation
2. We assume a client is new if his ip changes. DHCP means frequent ip change, best way to track session is by assigning unique id using
cookies. This can be a combination of id+UA etc. 
3. In the following analysis we can also to improve things use client+port+UA as a way for unique clients but this approach is slightly messy
as UA needs to be processed into some standard way for comparisons. 
4. For unique URLs ideally we should have a pattern to get rid of static content URLs. In basic case we can remove urls ending in for ex
.jpg, .css, .js, .png etc. 
5. Cache DFs appropriately. If DF is large like 500mb and you are working on local machine be careful with caching as you might use all of your memory
